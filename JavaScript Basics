1. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are 
- undefined, 
- null, 
- boolean, 
- string, 
- symbol, 
- bigint, 
- number, 
- and object.

2. When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

3. In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

4.  In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
This does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. 
The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string.

5. arr1.push(4);
var a = arr1.pop(); //to "pop" a value off of the end of an array
var a = arr1.shift(); //to remove a value off of the start of an array
arr1.unshift(); //.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

6. The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

7. Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). 
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

8. The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). 
If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise

9. To search for a property in an array of objects
if(prop in contacts[i])
