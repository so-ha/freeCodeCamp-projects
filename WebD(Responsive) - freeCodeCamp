2. Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes. 
Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, 
the styles are applied. You can have as many selectors and styles inside your media query as you want.
The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the device used to access the site.

3. In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.
