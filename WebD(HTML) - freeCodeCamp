1. HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include 
- main, 
- header, 
- footer, 
- nav, 
- video, 
- article, 
- section and others.

2. All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers 
- to improve accessibility 
- and is displayed if the image fails to load.

3. To create an internal link, 
you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to,
usually further down the page. 
You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. 
An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

4. target attribute of anchor tag helps to open the linked document in a new tab/window etc.

5. Nesting of tags can be done, example, <a> inside <p>

6. # is used to create a dead link.

7. Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

8. All related radio buttons/checkboxes should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. 
By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group 
ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, 
with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. 
This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the child input element. For example:
<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

9. the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.

10. The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.
The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all.
