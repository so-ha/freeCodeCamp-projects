1.  An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. 
They can be used within each other, as needed. 
For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section
<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content

2. The audio tag supports the controls attribute. 
This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. 
This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
</audio>

3. HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times. 
This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. 
A valid format of that date is held by the datetime attribute. 
This is the value accessed by assistive devices. 
It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.

4. The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. 
This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or higher.
